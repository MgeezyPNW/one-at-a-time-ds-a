[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/michaelageorge/one-at-a-time-ds-a.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/michaelageorge/one-at-a-time-ds-a)

This repository was created to store the solutions I discover to Data Structures and Algorithms problems as I practice them. Follow along and feel free to offer any criticism/advice!

A lot will be derived from the Code Fellows curriculum.
